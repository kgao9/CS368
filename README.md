This is one of my worst coding projects I've ever made

Think of it as a kind of legacy code. Completely deprecated
and confusing and weird.

I had learned about TDD, but I hadn't had it extremely formalized.
Plus I procrastinated on these coding assignments. It would be
the last time that I ever procrastinated with coding.

Yeah, I cannot even begin to emphasize my contempt.

Basically I only added this here so that I would have a full history
of my improvement.
